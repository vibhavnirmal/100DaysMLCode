# Machine Learning Programs
[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/vibhavnirmal/machinelearningprograms/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/vibhavnirmal/machinelearningprograms)

Currently working on various machine learning models and algorithms with different types of datasets available online.

### My Regression and Classification template:
I have created a basic template for beginners like me to solve most of machine learning problems with very small changes.
Basic changes according to the dataset is required though.
An example is given in this [code](https://github.com/vibhavnirmal/MachineLearningPrograms/tree/master/template "ML template")
